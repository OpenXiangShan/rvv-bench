# How to use in XiangShan & NEMU

At present, we only use this repository to verify whether XiangShan's vector expansion is correct, so we remove the scoring in the benchmark and changed the memory to 4KB. Besides, we use [AM](https://github.com/OpenXiangShan/nexus-am) to replace `printf` API.

## Compilation steps

1. Initialize the `git submodule update -- init`

2. Remove The rdinstret instruction in `./bench/rvv-chacha-poly/vpoly.s`. (Currently, there is no need to calculate scores)

3. [./bench/](./bench/) use `make all`

# RISC-V Vector benchmark

A collection of RISC-V Vector (RVV) benchmarks to help developers write portably performant RVV code.

Benchmark results can be found at: https://camel-cdr.github.io/rvv-bench-results

## Benchmarks ([./bench/](./bench/))

Contains a bunch of benchmark of different implementations of certain algorithms.

RVV code is currently only written in assembly, and uses [`./thirdparty/rvv-rollback.S`](./thirdparty/rvv-rollback.S) to support RVV 0.7.1 and RVV 1.0.

## Instruction cycle count ([./instructions/](./instructions/))

Measures the cycle count of RVV instructions by unrolling and looping over the given instruction repeatedly.

## Getting started

Start by configuring [./config.mk](./config.mk), such that `make` works and optionally [./run.sh](./run.sh), which allows you to compile and run using `make run`.

The default configuration should work with all recent clang builds and doesn't require a full cross compilation toolchain, because it builds in freestanding mode.
This means it will only work on linux, or linux syscall compatible OS.
You can either modify the platform specific code at the beginning of [./nolibc.h](./nolibc.h), or configure [./config.mk](./config.mk) to build a hosted build.

If you have a rvv 0.7.1 supporting board (which is as of now almost certain), make sure to use a rvv 0.7.1 compatible toolchain. I've used [this one](https://github.com/brucehoult/riscv-gnu-toolchain) for development.

### Running benchmarks ([./bench/](./bench/))

To run the benchmarks, first look through ([./bench/config.h](./bench/config.h)) and adjust it to your processor (e.g. set `HAS_E64`). If it takes too long to execute, try lowering `MAX_MEM`, which is used to scale the benchmark, and play around with the other constants until it executes in a reasonable amount of time and gives a relatively smooth graph.

Now you can just run the benchmarks using `make run` in the ([./bench/](./bench/)) directory, or `make` to just build the executables.


### Measuring cycle count ([./instructions/](./instructions/))

To run the cycle count measurement, first configure [instructions/rvv-1.0/config.h](instructions/rvv-1.0/config.h) to your processor.

Now you can run the measurement using `make run` in the ([./instructions/rvv-1.0/](./instructions/rvv-1.0/)) directory, or `make` to just build the executables.

For RVV 0.7.1 use the ([./instructions/thead-0.7.1/](./instructions/thead-0.7.1/)) directory instead.

## Contributing

Here are some suggestions of things that still need to be done.

* contribute a measurement of a new CPU to: https://github.com/camel-cdr/rvv-bench-results \
  You can just create an issue with a single json file, which contains all concatenated [./bench/](./bench/) results. (after proper setup, `make run > out.json` should do the trick). \
* implement non memory bound benchmarks
* implement more benchmarks
* better cycle count measurements: throughput vs latency (also: can we figure out the execution port configuration?)
* cycle count for load/stores
* cycle count for vsetvl
